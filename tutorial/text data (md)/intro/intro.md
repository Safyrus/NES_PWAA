# Chapter: Introduction

## Section: Introduction

Welcome to the second part of the tutorial!
This part is about how to use the engine.
But first! A little intro about it. Then we will learn how to use it.

### ==== The engine ==== 

This engine was firstly design to demake the first ace attorney on the NES.
(you may already know that)
And because all the logic of the game was dictated by the text.
I design the code to work without needing to know what the content of the game is.
(all data still need to respect a specific structure thought)

So, with a little of extra efforts.
And by compiling the text, images & audio in a format that the engine understand.
Once we give all this data to the engine, we have a working game!

This engine is, to over- simplified things,
RenPy but for the NES.
Note that we are still on the NES and limitations still apply.
(mainly graphical and audio)

### /!\ Important Note /!\ 

The engine is not fully finished yet!
For example, saves are not present yet.
I'm working on that and hope to finished it soon.

Oh and also, there is still a lot of bugs that I also hope to patch.
So you've been warn.

### == Type of games == 

Just to be sure, what type of game do you want to do with this engine?

Choice: (only affect the next dialog)
- A VN : Great!
- Other : Ah... well... you may want to reconsider


This engine was design to run visual novels type of game (like Ace Attorney).
Making other type of games may not be possible without editing the source code,
and making heavy modifications.

BUT!

Game with a strong focus on text and UI may still be possible.
I think making a Layton game is possible without or with very small modifications.

OK, I think that's everything.
Now let's finally learn how to use this 8-bit engine!
