Hi! And welcome to the next part of the tuto--
Wait...

It seems you haven't built this version of the game yourself.
Or you have downloaded it from a nightly build ?
Well, do what you want. I can't really stop you.

But if you want to build a game using this engine
I HIGHLY suggest following the tutorial on the project GitHub first!
If you haven't installed this project, you will not be able to create a game.

If you still wish to learn about how to use this engine, then...
Let's just pretend you have done everything correctly at this point, OK ?
