# P tag

The `<p>` tag is one of the most basic tag.
When encountered, it indicates the end a dialog box.
It also waits for user to press continue to go to the next one.
If you don't want to wait for an input, see the `<fp>` tag.

Why call it `<p>` ? I don't remember ?
For "page" or "press" maybe ?

## Example

This is the dialog before you press A<p>
And This is the dialog after you press A<p>

## Tips

You can use it to just wait for an input.
You don't need to have a dialog box displayed.
This can be used for some effect like displaying a background one by one.
Or something more interesting that need a player input.
