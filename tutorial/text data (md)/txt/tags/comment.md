# Comment tag

A comment tag start with `<!--` and end when `-->` is encountered.

Everything inside a comment tag is ignored.
They can be multiple lines long.
Use it to make part of your script more clear to you and other people.

## Example

Well, you will need to look at the source file to know that I actually put comment in there.

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->

An actual dialog.

<!--
a comment with
multiple lines
-->
```

## Tips

Don't hesitate to use them, really.
(more than I do at least)
