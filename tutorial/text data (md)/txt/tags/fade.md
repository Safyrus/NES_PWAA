# Fade tag

Fade the screen to/from black.
Switch between fade out and fade in depending on the last fade effect.
The default state when starting the game is "fade in".
The screen will stay in this fade state until another `fade` tag is encounter.

## Example

<background:BKG_FIELD>
I decide to take a nap<p>
<fade> <!-- fade out -->

...<p>

<background:BKG_SKY>
<fade> <!-- fade in -->
And reopen my eyes to see the sky<p>
