# B tag

The b tag is one of the most basic tag.
When encountered, the text will go to the start of the next line.

Why call it b ? Don't remember ?
For "break" maybe ?

## Example

This is a dialog<<>b><b>
with multiple lines<<>b><b>
of text.

## Tips

The dialog box is 28 characters wide.
So try to use it before having this many characters on a line.
Unless you want to go for a glitchy effect
with the text going out of the dialog box.
