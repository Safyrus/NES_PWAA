# Ext tag

Short for extend, this tag is for future used to extend the range of special characters.

The game text is made of 128 unique characters.
96 printable characters (letters, number, etc),
and 32 control characters (represented by tag).

To add more than 32 control characters / tags,
this tag is reserved for adding more in the future.

You cannot use it to add your own special characters, for this see the `event` tag.

The first argument is the special character you want to use.
Other arguments may be necessary depending on the special character used.

For now there is no `ext` special characters,
but that may change in the future
(this is the point of this character after all)
