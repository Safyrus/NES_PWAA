# Text data (but in Markdown)

OK, I lied.
The rest of the tutorial is not only found in the game,
but in this folder too.

This is just what the game text data is but in Markdown
It is done before the real text data for readabilityâ€™s sake
(don't have all the tags inside the text).
I prefer that you use the in-game version because it showcases directly what can be done.
You will still get the same information nonetheless, so do what you want.

Start [here](intro/md_build.md).
