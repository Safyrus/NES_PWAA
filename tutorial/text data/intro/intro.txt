Welcome to the second part<b>
of the tutorial!<p>

This part is about how to<b>
use the engine.<p>

But first!<wait:30> A little<b>
intro about it.<wait:60>Then we will<b>
learn how to use it.<p>

<b>
==== The engine ====<b>
<p>

This engine was firstly<b>
design to demake the first<b>
ace attorney on the NES.<p>

(you may already know that)<p>

And because all the logic of<b>
the game was dictated by the<b>
text.<p>

I design the code to work<b>
without needing to know what<b>
the content of the game is.<p>

(all data still need to<b>
respect a specific<b>
structure thought)<p>

So, with a little of<b>
extra efforts.<p>

And by compiling the text,<b>
images & audio in a format<b>
that the engine understand.<p>

Once we give all this data<b>
to the engine, we have<b>
a working game!<p>

This engine is, to over-<b>
simplified things,
RenPy but for the NES.<p>

Note that we are still on<b>
the NES and limitations<b>
still apply.<p>

(mainly graphical and audio)<p>

<b>
/!\ Important Note /!\<b>
<p>

The engine is not fully<b>
finished yet!<p>

For example, saves are not<b>
present yet.<p>

I'm working on that and<b>
hope to finished it soon.<p>

Oh and also, there is still<b>
a lot of bugs that I also<b>
hope to patch.<p>

So you've been warn.<p>


<b>
== Type of games ==<b>
<p>

Just to be sure,<b>
what type of game do you<b>
want to do with this engine?<p>

<!-- TODO choice -->
- A VN : Great!
- Other : Ah... well... you may want to reconsider


This engine was design to<b>
run visual novels type of<b>
game (like Ace Attorney).<p>

Making other type of games<b>
may not be possible without<b>
editing the source code,<p>

and making heavy<b>
modifications.<p>

BUT!<p>

Game with a strong focus on<b>
text and UI may still be<b>
possible.<p>

I think making a Layton game<b>
is possible without or with<b>
very small modifications.<p>


OK, I think that's<b>
everything.<p>

Now let's finally learn how<b>
to use this 8-bit engine!<p>
