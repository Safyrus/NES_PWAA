Hi!<wait:60>And welcome to the<b>
next part of the tuto--<wait:60><b>
Wait...<p>

It seems you haven't built<b>
this version of the game<b>
yourself.<p>

Or you have downloaded it<b>
from a nightly build ?<p>

Well, do what you want.<b>
I can't really stop you.<p>

But if you want to build a<b>
game using this engine<p>

I HIGHLY suggest following<b>
the tutorial on the project<b>
GitHub first!<p>

If you haven't installed<b>
this project, you will not<b>
be able to create a game.<p>

If you still wish to<b>
learn about how to use this<b>
engine, then...<p>

Let's just pretend you have<b>
done everything correctly<b>
at this point, OK ?<p>
