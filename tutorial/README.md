# Tutorial

**IMPORTANT:**

This is a work in progress. The Tutorial and some features of the engine are not finished yet.

----

This tutorial is address to people wanted to use the NES visual novel engine (NES-VN) to create their own visual novel on the NES.

Note that making games using the engine is not that hard (you basically just write text in a .txt for the main part), installing it might be more tricky, especially if you never set up a development environment before.

This is the first part of the tutorial on how to install and set up the project.
The second is inside the `tuto.nes` file. **(TODO)**

1. [Download the project](1-download.md)
